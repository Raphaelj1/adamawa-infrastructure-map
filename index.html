					<h3>Healthcare Infrastructure in Adamawa State – Operational Overview</h3>
					<p>
						Our project focuses on mapping healthcare facilities across Adamawa State,
						specifically highlighting primary healthcare facilities. The key
						infrastructure data includes:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Ownership</p></li>
						<li><p>Facility Level</p></li>
						<li><p>Operational Status</p></li>
						<li><p>Operational: Facilities currently providing services.</p></li>
						<li><p>Closed: Facilities that are no longer functioning.</p></li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Pending Construction: Facilities that are planned but not yet built.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Completed but Pending Operations: Facilities that are built but not
								yet open to the public.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="info-section">
					<h3>Data Source</h3>
					<p>
						The data for this map was sourced from the
						<strong>
							<a href="https://hfr.health.gov.ng/facilities/hospitals-list"
								>Nigeria Health Facility Registry</a
							></strong
						>, ensuring accuracy and reliability in our representation of healthcare
						infrastructure.
					</p>

					<h3>Insights from the Map</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Operational Facilities: </strong>These are the currently functional
						healthcare facilities that serve the public. They provide essential health
						services and are critical for daily operations.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Closed Facilities: </strong>These facilities represent gaps in
						healthcare service delivery. Reopening or replacing these could be key to
						improving health outcomes.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Pending Construction: </strong>Facilities in this category highlight
						areas where new infrastructure is planned but construction is yet to be
						completed. This data is crucial for understanding future healthcare
						expansion.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Completed but Pending Operations: </strong>
						These facilities are built but are not yet operational, signalling either
						administrative delays or resource allocation issues that need to be
						addressed.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="info-section">
					<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
					<p>Our map is fully interactive, allowing users to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Zoom in and out for a detailed view of healthcare facilities.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Filter by operational status, enabling a clear understanding of
								which facilities are functional and which need attention.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Click on specific facilities to get more detailed information, such
								as latitude, longitude, ownership, and status.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This infrastructure data will help decision-makers in planning healthcare
						development in Adamawa State. The visualization offers a user-friendly
						experience with distinct icons and color codes to differentiate between
						operational statuses, allowing for easy navigation and insight extraction.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="info-section">
					<h3>Relevance for Decision-Making</h3>
					<p>
						The map highlights critical areas where healthcare infrastructure is either
						lacking or underutilized. Decision-makers can use this information to
						prioritize investments in closed and pending healthcare facilities to
						improve overall healthcare delivery in Adamawa State. By focusing on
						operational gaps, this project provides actionable insights for strategic
						healthcare planning.
