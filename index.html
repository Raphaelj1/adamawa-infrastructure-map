					<h3>Healthcare Infrastructure Story in Adamawa State</h3>
					<p>
						In Adamawa, there is a huge divide between urban and rural healthcare
						infrastructure. Urban centers are home to well-equipped hospitals, while
						rural areas face significant challenges in accessing even basic healthcare.
						Our interactive map illustrates these <strong>healthcare gaps</strong> and
						highlights the need for strategic investments to improve healthcare access
						across the state.
					</p>

					<h3>Urban Centers: High-Density but Overburdened</h3>
					<p>
						Urban Areas - Yola, which is the city capital is marked in red on our map,
						representing its high density of hospitals with Federal Medical Center
						having a 1002 bed capacity. Major hospitals like FMC Yola, provide critical
						care, but are pverbudurned due to the high population density and patients
						from rural areas. These urban hospitals are well-equipped with specialized
						departments but struggle with long waiting times and overcrowded emergency
						rooms, indicating the need for expanded capacity to meet growing demands.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Rural Areas: Sparse and Underdeveloped</h3>
					<p>
						Marked in yellow, Toungo LGA is an example of limited healthcare access. The
						area has only a handful of small clinics, with no fully equipped general
						hospital nearby. - Residents in this area often need to travel long
						distances to receive even basic medical services, resulting in delayed
						emergency care.

						<p>
							With only two clinics available, residents in Toungo must travel up to
							70 km for emergency care, contributing to avoidable delays and poor
							health outcomes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Proposed Solutions: Establishing new healthcare centers in these areas
							could drastically improve access and save lives in medical emergencies.
